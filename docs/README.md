# LIBBGPIOD
#### An easy to use GPIO Library

This is a gpio device library for Linux.

Note the extra 'b' in libbgpiod.  This is not a fork of the fine
libgpiod, nor is it a plug-in replacement.

It does however aim to be functionally equivalent and easier to use.

This is largely by being more thoroughly
[documented](https://bloodnok-marine.github.io/libbgpiod).

## Status

It seems to work, but it's considered alpha quality.  It is still a
work in progress.  Once the author thinks it's good enough, the version
number will get bumped and it will be considered production quality.

It will have been successfully driving real hardware for an extended
period of time by then.
